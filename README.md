# Web-test

Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is a small project where I'm trying to write some automated tests for web application. In this particular example I'm testing the Amazon.de.

### Tools
In this project I've used [Nightwatch](https://nightwatchjs.org/api/commands/#isVisible).
I'm still going to add more test cases and then I want to try out Cucumber ðŸ¥’ integration to learn behaviour driven tests.
All test cases are listed in TCs.txt file in the root folder.
